    The graphics API we decided to use is Vulkan, it is the most trendy graphics API at the moment and therefore it is the most beneficial to learn. Although it is much more complex than OpenGL, but I adapted to Vulkan Programming with early preparation and countless hours of learning.

    As one of the most experienced programmers and game developers in the team, I took the lead in product management and code contribution.
    
    The project felt like exploring an unknown territory since none of us had any prior game engine development experience. I spent the trimester break learning as much as I could about game engine development. I found some useful resources that helped me understand key concepts such as OpenGL programming and Entity Component Systems (ECS).
    
    The development was a wild ride, but by constantly challenging ourselves, we managed to deliver what exceeded our initial expectation.`,
